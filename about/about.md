## About Me üë®‚Äçüíª

Hello <span class="wave">üëã</span>  
**Rituraj** here, Tech is my daily dose dopamine. been advocate for open-source as freedom matters. I like to collaborate  and build for human not machines. I also blog occasionally.

need to have full control over my machine and automate alot of stuff with scripts while having a pleaseant looking desktop to keep up the moral so i've been using linux, i started with artix and have switched to nixos since the beginning for this decade due to it's declarative nature despite systemd.

local-first and cross-platform is both the present and the future. Technologies like WebAssembly and WebGPU excite me as they shape the future of the web. I'm also rooting for RISC-V (Open Architecture).

Part of the plan is to push implicit parallel computing forward with Interaction-Calculas to cover general-purpose computing, challenging existing algorithms and operating systems to fully embrace parallel computing as if serial computing never existed. XR also excites me, especially the gaps it's starting to fill in technology and real world interaction.

Theory of computation such as Lambda calculus, automated proofs and parallelism, game engines, and physical mechanics all fascinate me.

Urging to bring on a future where jobs are not a necessity for survival but a choice, where people pursue what truly drives them, and their contributions define their status. Artificial Intelligence can help?

Thanks for the visit!
