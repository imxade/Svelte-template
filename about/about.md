## About Me üë®‚Äçüíª

Hey <span class="wave">üëã</span>  
**Rituraj** here. Tech has always been exciting, especially open-source, because transparency matters. The focus is on building for people, not just machines. Collaboration is key, and blogging shows up now and then to share thoughts and ideas.

Don't think overhead or execution order justifies asynchronous functions not being the default.

Cozy looks, automation and full control over the system is a must, hence Linux is my way. It started with Artix, then shifted to NixOS, the declarative setup feels clean and efficient, even with systemd in the mix.

Local-first should define the future. WebAssembly and WebGPU are helping to make it possible, while closing the gap between native and web apps. Also cheering hard for RISC-V and the openness it brings.

There's a strong pull toward theoretical frameworks like Interaction Calculus for implicit parallel computing. The idea is to challenge current algorithms and operating systems to treat parallelism as the default, as if serial computing never existed in the first place.

XR is another thrilling space, blending the digital and physical worlds. It's opening up possibilities in medical fields like eye treatment and physical activites, pretty much the kind of future people imagined 50 years ago. The fascination extends to computation theory too lambda calculus, automated proofs, parallelism, game engines, and even physical mechanics.

Dreaming of a world where jobs aren‚Äôt tied to survival. 
People creating and contributing because they want to, not because they have to.
Maybe AI can help to some extent.

Thanks for dropping by!
