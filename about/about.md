## About Me üë®‚Äçüíª

Hey <span class="wave">üëã</span>  
I'm **Rituraj**, and tech is the cause dopamine hits. Open-source has always been the way because freedom matters. The focus is always on building for humans, not just machines. Collaboration is key, and blogging pops up now and then to share thoughts.

Having full control over the machine is a must, along with automating tons of stuff through scripts. Not just functionality, cozy looking desktop important too. So, Linux is the way. Started out with Artix but switched to NixOS early on in the decade because declarative setup feels like breeze, even with systemd in the mix.

Local-first and cross-platform? That‚Äôs where it‚Äôs at both now and down the road. Tech like WebAssembly and WebGPU are super exciting because they‚Äôre reshaping the web‚Äôs future. Also rooting hard for RISC-V.

The vision includes pushing implicit parallel computing forward using Interaction-Calculus to handle general-purpose computing, challenging current algorithms and operating systems to fully embrace parallelism as if serial computing never existed.

XR is another thrilling frontier, filling gaps between tech and real-world interaction. The fascination extends to theory of computation including Lambda calculus, automated proofs, parallelism as well as game engines and physical mechanics.

The dream? A world where jobs aren‚Äôt tied to survival. People creating and contributing because they want to, not because they have to. Maybe AI can help get there.

Thanks for the visit!
