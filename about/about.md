## About Me üë®‚Äçüíª

Hello <span class="wave">üëã</span>  
I'm **Rituraj**, Technology is my dopamine, and freedom is everything to me. hence, I advocate for open-source. I love collaborating and building resilient abstractions for humans because machines don‚Äôt have preferences. I also blog occasionally.

I believe cross-platform is both the present and the future. Technologies like WebAssembly and WebGPU excite me as they shape the future of the web. I'm also rooting for RISC-V (Open Architecture).

I want to push implicit parallel computing forward with Interaction-Calculas to cover general-purpose computing, challenging existing algorithms and operating systems to fully embrace parallel computing as if serial computing never existed. XR also excites me, especially the gaps it's starting to fill in technology and real world interaction.

Theory of computation such as Lambda calculus, automated proofs and parallelism, game engines, and physical mechanics all fascinate me.

I always wanted to bring on a future where jobs are not a necessity for survival but a choice, where people pursue what truly drives them, and their contributions define their status. Artificial Intelligence can help?

Thanks for the visit!
