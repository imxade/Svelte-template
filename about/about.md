## About Me üë®‚Äçüíª

Hey <span class="wave">üëã</span>  
**Rituraj** here. 
Technology has always excited me especially open source, because transparency matters. For me, it‚Äôs about building for people, not just for machines. Collaboration plays a key role, and occassionally I share my thoughts through blogging.

I believe asynchronous execution should be the default, much like how the BEAM VM (Erlang/Elixir) treats concurrency as a natural building block. I‚Äôm also keeping an eye on RISC-V and photonic chips.


Sooner or later, people will accept P2P as the way for private communication, rather than relying on servers, even if the data is encrypted.

When it comes to operating systems, I value coziness, automation, and full control that‚Äôs why NixOS is my go to, Declarative setups feels the cleanest, cant wait for [Mobile NixOS' GSI](https://github.com/mobile-nixos/mobile-nixos/issues/818).


Keeping the bigger picture in mind might just be a habit because whenever I revisit past decisions, I usually land on the same conclusions. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve learned to document the reasoning behind what I build, at least when it comes to code.


I'm also drawn towards computation theories, like Interaction Calculus providing implicit parallel evaluation (computing). Alongside this, I also want to explore lambda calculus, automated proofs, parallelism, game engines, and even the mechanics of physical systems. I enjoy reimagining fundamentals for example, wondering what computing might look like if concepts such as serialization had never existed.

Another space I find exciting is Extended Reality it blends the digital and physical worlds and could completely change the way we interact with software. It‚Äôs already unlocking possibilities in healthcare, from eye treatments to physical therapy, and feels like the kind of sci-fi future people dreamed about decades ago.

Finally, I dream of a world where jobs aren‚Äôt tied to survival, 
where people create and contribute because they want to, not because they have to. Maybe AI can help us edge closer to that vision.

Thanks for dropping by!
